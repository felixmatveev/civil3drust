## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cargo project depending on `acadrust` 0.6.5.
- `alignment` module: tangent-only horizontal alignment with stationing,
  `point_at_station`, and `set_segment_length` (downstream PIs translate
  with the edited segment).
- `inventory` module: lists AECC classes from a DWG's class table.
- `inventory` example CLI (`cargo run --example inventory -- file.dwg`).
- README with project goal, first milestone, and cleanroom rules.
- `DECISIONS.md` design log and `docs/` folder for format findings.
- `raw` module: stored bytes of AECC records via acadrust (`records`,
  `open` with failsafe fallback) and bit-level helpers (`get_f64`,
  `set_f64`, `find_f64s`, `utf16_strings`, `changed_bit_ranges`).
- `rawdiff` example: compares AECC records between two DWGs (summary of all
  classes, or per-class detail with changed doubles; bit-level Myers
  alignment for records that changed size).
- `dumprec` example: writes the raw bytes of one class's records to files.
- `docs/alignment-object.md`: first findings on the `AECC_ALIGNMENT` record
  (section order, proxy graphics, design tangent, station-reference cache,
  Civil 3D round trip of a lengthened tangent).
- Decisions D-005 (study via acadrust raw bytes) and D-006 (controlled pairs
  both saved by Civil 3D).
- Dev-dependency `similar` 2 (MIT/Apache-2.0) for the bit-level diff.
- `raw::get_bit` and `raw::read_bl` (bit-coded long, ODA specification).
- `aecc_alignment` module: finds tangent element records
  (`tangent_records`), orders them by before/after links (`chain`), and
  decodes a tangent-only `AECC_ALIGNMENT` into an `Alignment` (`decode`).
  Start station is not decoded yet and is set to 0. Five unit tests on
  synthetic records.
- `alignments` example: lists decoded alignments with element IDs, links,
  coordinates and bit offsets.
- `docs/alignment-object.md`: sample S5 (three tangents), tangent element
  record layout and linkage, template `3DSOLID` note; decision D-007.
